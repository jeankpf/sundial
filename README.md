# Do you want to build a solar clock or to be able to know the real time according to the position of the Sun?
Don't wait anymore and check for both answers in this repository!

## What do you need to use this script?
You will need the [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/) Wrapper developped and maintained by Petrus Hyv√∂nen who works for the [Swedish Space Corporation](https://www.sscspace.com/) and that you can find [here!](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit-labs/python-wrapper).

Please follow the instructions described in this wiki [here!](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit-labs/python-wrapper/-/wikis/installation) before using this script (I would recommend you to use the conda packages as it is way easier!)

### Notes
The mural sundial version is not working yet, it seems there is a problem in this last change of reference frame
